# Limba
Play the cute thumb piano on your phone :)

Limba is a virtual version of the Kalimba, which is  inspired by the African Mbira. Developed natively for iOS using Swift.
Included a Firebase dependecy, solely to learn the platform. Used Firebase Authentication, and Firestore, to create users
and to add them to the database.
This is my first iOS app, and I welcome any and all feedback. I have a to-do list of aspects to add/fix on this project as well.

## Getting Started
To play, either register/login, or press the 'just play' button and start to tap the keys!

## To-Do
